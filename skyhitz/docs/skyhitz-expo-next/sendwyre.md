## What is done?

Sendwyre integration is ready, all necessary logic and components are there, but they are commented out for now.

## What needs to be done?

When we get verified, we need to generate Access Token for the production environment.
Then we have to add this token to vercel environment variables for production. After we add it,
we are all ready to uncomment sendwyre components and it should work!
